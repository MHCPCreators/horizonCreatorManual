### Draw Calls

<mark>**Challenge question (for the doc)**: are draw calls really ever the primary issue? Is this information truly used and needed by 1p and 2p? A lot of Horizon's behavior is "like other 3D engines". What specific things (about Horizon) do we actually need to document, assuming that someone is technically savvy (enough) already?</mark>

- Do not rely on Horizon to do any draw call batching. Meaning each instantiated asset is at least 1 draw call.
- Hypothesis / guess: UI Gizmos are rendered into textures on the _CPU_ and then rendered as single quads with a texture on the GPU (don't know about batching...). What about name tags?

- Theory: 1 draw call per avatar, 1 draw call per UI Gizmo, 1+ draw calls per instantiated asset, 1 draw call per FX/trail gizmo that is running, 1 draw call per emotes (per player that is emoting), 1+ draw call per NPC
  - In build mode: 1 draw call per gizmo

| Element                                          | Draw Call                 | Notes                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Player                                           | 3+ each                   | Avatar, name tag, emotes |
| Entities                                         | 1+ each                   | Per instantiated asset   |
| UI Gizmo                                         | 1 each                    | back-face / occlusion?   |
| Particle / Trail Gizmo                           | 1 each                    | occlusion-culled?        |
| Text Gizmo                                       | 1 each                    | THESE MAY BE BATCHED!    |
| Door Gizmo                                       | 1 each                    | occlusion-culled?        |
| Leaderboard / Quests / Media Board / Purchase UI | 1 each                    | occlusion-culled?        |
| Mirror Gizmo                                     | 2x total draw call count? | ... REALLY?!...          |
| Pop-ups                                          | 1 per visible             | occluded?                |
| Projectile Launcher                              | 1 per visible             |

!!! info There are draw calls outside a creator's control
    Things like the sky, personal UI, the wrist UI, teleport visuals, onscreen controls, and many other elements may add to the "base number" of draw-calls.

!!! tip Group entities with the same materials together into an asset when possible
    If you have 50 bricks with the same material all in 1 asset Horizon will batch that to be 1 draw call. If those are instead a single brick duplicated 50 times then that will be at least 50 draw calls.

    If you have an asset with 25 bricks of material A and 25 of material B then this will be 2 draw calls. If instead they were all duplicated then there would be 50 draw calls.

!!! warning Multi-material assets increase draw call count
    If an asset has multiple materials or material textures then the draw call count will increase by the number of them.
