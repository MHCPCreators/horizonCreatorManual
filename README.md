# Guide

## Setup

In VSCode install the extension:
  Markdown Preview Enhanced

  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced

## Editing

Open the file HorizonTechnicalDoc.md in VSCode.

Open the Markdown preview using:
  Mac: cmd-k v
  Windows: ctrl-k v

## Generating the PDF

When you want to "generate the PDF" make sure the preview tab is open. Click this [â‰£] icon in the bottom right (you may have to hover there for it to be visible) and then click:
```
Export > Chrome (Puppeteer) > PDF
```

## Guidelines

1. **TODO** - Use 'TODO' anywhere in the doc where there is an explicit question or issue that needs review. This makes it easy to search for 'TODO' throughout the doc.
1. **Entity, not Object** - Use "entity" instead of "object" unless referring to a place where Horizon specifically calls it an "Object".
1. **Sample code** - prefer technical explanation over example code. Write an example only when the example provides clarity that is hard to explain otherwise.

## Info

Note that you can also edit in the preview pane!
