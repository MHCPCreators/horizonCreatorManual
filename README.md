# Guide

## Setup

In VSCode install the extension:
  Markdown Preview Enhanced

  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced

## Editing

Open the file HorizonTechnicalDoc.md in VSCode.

Open the Markdown preview using:
  Mac: cmd-k v
  Windows: ctrl-k v

## Generating the PDF

When you want to "generate the PDF" make sure the preview tab is open. Click this [â‰£] icon in the bottom right (you may have to hover there for it to be visible) and then click:
```
Export > Chrome (Puppeteer) > PDF
```

## Guidelines

1. Use 'TODO' anywhere in the doc where there is an explicit question or issue that needs review. This makes it easy to search for 'TODO' throughout the doc.
1. Use "entity" instead of "object" unless referring to a place where Horizon specifically calls it an "Object".

## Info

Note that you can also edit in the preview pane!
